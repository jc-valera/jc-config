    <h1> Aboute custom Git Bash.</h1>
</div>

Hey 👋, sometime I like to spend a little time in app custom. 😄

In this case I'd like to share you my own custom for Git Bash. I will be honest, I don't like to install many things to get a custom. The terminal as an example.

I like a bit follow the KISS philosophy from Arch Linux.

So. this is my custom for the git bash terminal 

This is the default git bash terminal 



and I modified to this




All customs I maked in the directories from git, maybe you would like to create a .bashrc file in the root path. 🤷‍♂️

In other case, I created aliases for git and aliases for the navigation inside the terminal, those aliases are usefully for me. 👨

I hope you enjoy it.
